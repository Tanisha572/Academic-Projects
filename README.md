This repository contains small programs implemented throughout the academic years. These programs cater to ML and AI problems. 
## <u>Machine Learning:</u>

- various types of models like linear regression, logistic regression and perceptrons are used to draw insights and see patterns on well-known datasets like iris, auto, breast-cancer, MNIST, advertising.
- the models are built from scratch, as well as pre-defined, in-built models from libraries like sklearn are used.
- visualisation are created using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

## <u>Artificial Intelligence:</u>

- basic to medium programs are implemented using GNU-prolog
- knowlege bases are also used in some programs to provide solution to given problem and domain.
